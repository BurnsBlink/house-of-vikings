    description: "'Northmen' (as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle calls them) attacked the Christian monastery at Lindisfarne in Northumbria, in north-east England. Northumbria was an English kingdom, and its monasteries were famous for books, art and treasures. On a January day, the longships arrived and the Vikings attacked. They burned buildings, stole treasures, murdered monks, and terrified everyone. Some Christian Church leaders said the Vikings were sent by God, to punish people in England for doing wrong.",

    description: "In 838, a large Viking fleet under the Norwegian sea king Turgeis (Thorgils) entered the River Liffey and established a land base for their operations. By 840, the Vikings were spending the winter on the island and establishing permanent bases along the coasts.  While many of these camps did not last long others, such as the one established on the River Liffey, grew into large towns. On the River Liffey, the Viking outpost at Dúbh Linn later became Dublin",

    description: "The Danish Viking Reginheri, one of the figures scholars link to the legend of Ragnar Lothbrok, led a violent series of attacks on what is now France and sieged Paris, which was then an island city, in the year 845. Historical accounts indicate that he sailed a fleet of about 120 ships along the Seine, raiding the city of Rouen as he progressed. After Rouen, West Frankish King Charles the Bald sent an army to protect the Abbey of Saint Denis, but Reginheri's raiders routed this force and hanged 111 of their prisoners as a tribute to Odin. They went on to pillage Paris, staying until King Charles the Bald offered a payment of nearly 5,700 pounds of gold and silver for their departure.",

    description: "After sacking Pisa, Italy, Björn Ironside heard that the Holy City of Rome lay within his reach, only a short journey inland. Aware of the riches that had been plundered from various abbeys in England and France he anticipated the vast wealth that could be plundered from the central city of Christendom. Unfortunately for Björn he had been misled as to how far away Rome was. When his army reached the town of Luna they thought that they had reached the Eternal City and began a siege. However, in Luna the Vikings had found their match and the siege looked as if it would turn into a protracted engagement. Eager to get inside Björn fabricated an incredible deceit. Björn let it be known to the bishop of Luna that he had died but had converted to Christianity on his deathbed and wished to be buried in consecrated ground inside the town. Not willing to deny Björn a Christian burial the bishop gave permission for Björn’s body to be brought in by a small honour guard. However, once his coffin was laid in the church Björn astounded the assembled clerics by leaping from the coffin after which he and his “honour guard” hacked a bloody path to the town gates, opening them and allowing his army in to sack the town.",
